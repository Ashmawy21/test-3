**Description**

Chess is played on a board of 64 squares alternate between two colors: light (e.g. white) and dark (e.g. black).
A playerâ€™s army consists of 16 pieces that begin play on the two ranks closest to that player.
There are six different types of pieces; king, rook, bishop, queen, knight, and pawn. Each has a different appearance and moves.

- Chess is played between two opponents with different colored pieces (usually black and white).
- White moves first, and players take turns following fixed rules until the end of the game.
- Legal moves should be highlighted in green, and illegal moves (e.g., blocking own pieces, putting the king in check) should be highlighted in red.
- Eaten pieces of each player should be displayed on the sidebar.
- The win condition is to force the opponent's king into checkmate.

2. Pieces:

   a) Pawn:
   - Moves forward and captures diagonally.
   - On the first move, it can move one or two squares.
   - When reaching the opposite end of the board, it can be promoted to any other piece (except the king).

   b) Rook (Castle):
   - Moves vertically or horizontally to any unobstructed square.

   c) King:
   - Moves one square in any direction.
   - Castling: A special move where the king moves two spaces towards a rook, and the rook moves to the other side of the king under specific conditions.

   d) Bishop (Elephant):
   - Moves diagonally, bypassing other pieces.
   - Can change the diagonal color by moving one square horizontally.

   e) Queen:
   - Combines the powers of the rook and bishop, the most mobile and powerful piece.

   f) Knight:
   - Moves in an L shape: two squares horizontally or vertically, and then three squares in the perpendicular direction.
